Tic tac toe rules:
To play tic tac toe, two players, X and O, take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols. If
a player succeeds in placing three symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, that player wins. If all the
squares are filled without either player completing a row, the game is a draw.

How to play in the app:
When you run the game, you will be presented with a menu screen that has two buttons: "play" and "quit". Clicking
"quit" will shut down the application. Click "play" will load a game screen displaying a timer and tic tac toe board.
There is a back button in the upper left that will take you back to the menu screen, and text at the bottom that shows
which player's turn it is. The timer starts counting down when the first player makes their first move, and on each
subsequent move, the player will have 10 seconds to play. If they don't play within 10 seconds, it will become the
other player's turn. When the game is over, it will display who won (or if it was a draw) and provide three buttons:
"restart" will start a new game, "menu" will take you back to the menu, and "quit" will shut down the application.

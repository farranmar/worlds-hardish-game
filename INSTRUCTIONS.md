## Alchemy 2.0 Instructions

Run the game by running the `main` function in `alc/Main`. When the game runs, you are taken to a menu with "play"
and "quit" buttons. Pressing "quit" will shut down the app, and pressing "play" will load the game. Once in the game,
click and drag units from the menu on the right to the map. Dragging and releasing units on top of each other will cause
them to collide and combine (if applicable). Dragging units to the trash can in the bottom right will
delete them. You can pan around the map using the arrow keys or WASD, and
you can zoom in or out by scrolling. Pressing the back button will take you back to the menu screen.

Possible combinations:  
air + fire = sun  
earth + water = sprout  
sprout + sun = tree  
tree + fire = dead tree  
dead tree + water =  mushroom (final item, cannot be combined)

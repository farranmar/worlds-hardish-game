## Wiz I Instructions

**Navigation:** Through the menu screen, the user can choose to play the game, change the settings, or quit the 
application. Changing settings allows the user to select a specific seed, so they can play on the same map 
multiple times. In the game, the back button in the upper left returns the user to the menu. Exiting the game 
then hitting "play" again will restart the game on a new map.
  
**Play:** The player can move using WASD and shoot using the space bar. Running into an enemy will kill the player, 
and shooting an enemy will kill the enemy. Projectiles shoot in the direction the player is currently facing. The 
player wins by finding the stairs at the end of the level and exiting.

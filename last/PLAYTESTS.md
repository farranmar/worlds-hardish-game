# Final II Playtests

### Playtest 1: Interviewed by Josh
--- This playtester felt that the game should have more content. He also felt that the checkpoints were not clear and should be adjusted to seem friendlier to the player.

--- Lastly, this player felt that the game is too easy. 

### Playtest 2: Interviewed by Josh
--- This playtester was wary of the checkpoints, and avoided them. However, they didn't need to use them, meaning that level 1 did not introduce the mechanics we wanted.

--- This player felt the level editor was unintuitive, and also found a small bug in it, in that building blocks are not static colliders.

### Playtest 3: Interviewed by Mary
--- This playtester was also unclear on what the checkpoints were at first, but did end up running into them and realizing what they were while playing. 

--- The playtester also felt that the first level was very simple, and wanted more complexity. She wished it was more difficult, such as either involving some puzzle like a maze or just better mechanics.

### Playtest 4: Interviewed by Mary
--- This playtester said that the game was straightfoward to play, but wasn't clear what the consequences of running into the different objects (wall, ball, checkpoint) were.

--- Additionally, this player felt the color scheme could be improved.

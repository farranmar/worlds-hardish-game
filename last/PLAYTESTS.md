### Playtest 4: Interviewed by Mary
-- This player wished there was some way to move the deathball+path+pathpoints together by grabbing the path, rather than having to move the endpoints only

-- This player also felt that the levels progressed in difficulty too quickly, and though that there should be more easy and intermediate levels.

### Playtest 5: Interviewed by Mary
-- This player was frustrated by the difficulty lining up deathballs pixel-perfect with each other, so that they would be properly synced if they were meant to be moving together. 

-- While more of an aesthetic issue and less of a gameplay issue, this tester also wished the walls were easier to line up each other.

### Playtest 6: Interviewed by Mary
-- This player wished there was a way to bring elements in the editor forwards or backwards, so they could control what was on top in the event that two elements overlapped.

--- This player said the game was fun, and wished there was more levels to progress through, especially if levels began to introduce more mechanics further along

# Final III Playtests

### Playtest 1: Interviewed by Josh
--- When working with the level editor, this player was unable to intuit how each of the controls worked. She was especially confused by the controls to set up the death balls.  

### Playtest 2: Interviewed by Josh
--- This player enjoyed the level editor, though they wished they had more options to use. They were also frustrated when they made several balls in a line, but small differences led to them getting out of sync when the level was played. 

--- They also were annoyed by the inability to remove items from the level.

### Playtest 3: Interviewed by Josh
--- This player didn't want to play with the level editor much, so there was not a ton of content for them (as we only have one fully-implemented level). However, they said they liked the feel of the controls and the inspiration, as they had played the flash game it was based on.

### Playtest 4: Interviewed by Mary
--- This player initially didn't realize what the checkpoint was, but figured it out after running into it for the first time then dying.

--- This player wasn't sure what the red dots (for resizing) were in the level editor, but figured it out as well after clicking them. They also didn't realize what the deathball paths were and that the deathballs could move.

### Playtest 5: Interviewed by Mary
--- The player also didn't know what the checkpoint was, and actually thought the first level was impossible to complete because they though the second opening was too small to pass through, so they became discouraged as they didn't know how to progress.

--- This player also initially wasn't sure what to do in the level editor, but was able to understand it after clicking around a bit. They expressed they wished there was a way to delete objects in the editor, and to test their game in the editor.

### Playtest 6: Interviewed by Mary
--- This player wasn't sure how to play the level they made in the editor through saving it, and tried to move the player in the editor itself through WASD.

--- This player also uncovered a couple bug in the editor, where clicking on the resize dot where it overlaps an object causes the object to both resize and move simultaneously. Additionally, when dragging objects from the menu, if you click where the (invisible) red dot is, it will resize the object in the menu, and all subsequent copies will also be that size.


# Final II Playtests

### Playtest 1: Interviewed by Josh
--- This playtester felt that the game should have more content. He also felt that the checkpoints were not clear and should be adjusted to seem friendlier to the player.

--- Lastly, this player felt that the game is too easy. 

### Playtest 2: Interviewed by Josh
--- This playtester was wary of the checkpoints, and avoided them. However, they didn't need to use them, meaning that level 1 did not introduce the mechanics we wanted.

--- This player felt the level editor was unintuitive, and also found a small bug in it, in that building blocks are not static colliders.

### Playtest 3: Interviewed by Mary
--- This playtester was also unclear on what the checkpoints were at first, but did end up running into them and realizing what they were while playing. 

--- The playtester also felt that the first level was very simple, and wanted more complexity. She wished it was more difficult, such as either involving some puzzle like a maze or just better mechanics.

### Playtest 4: Interviewed by Mary
--- This playtester said that the game was straightfoward to play, but wasn't clear what the consequences of running into the different objects (wall, ball, checkpoint) were.

--- Additionally, this player felt the color scheme could be improved.

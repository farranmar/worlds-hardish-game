# Final III Playtests

### Playtest 1: Interviewed by Josh
--- When working with the level editor, this player was unable to intuit how each of the controls worked. She was especially confused by the controls to set up the death balls.  

### Playtest 2: Interviewed by Josh
--- This player enjoyed the level editor, though they wished they had more options to use. They were also frustrated when they made several balls in a line, but small differences led to them getting out of sync when the level was played. 

--- They also were annoyed by the inability to remove items from the level.

### Playtest 3: Interviewed by Josh
--- This player didn't want to play with the level editor much, so there was not a ton of content for them (as we only have one fully-implemented level). However, they said they liked the feel of the controls and the inspiration, as they had played the flash game it was based on.


# Final II Playtests

### Playtest 1: Interviewed by Josh
--- This playtester felt that the game should have more content. He also felt that the checkpoints were not clear and should be adjusted to seem friendlier to the player.

--- Lastly, this player felt that the game is too easy. 

### Playtest 2: Interviewed by Josh
--- This playtester was wary of the checkpoints, and avoided them. However, they didn't need to use them, meaning that level 1 did not introduce the mechanics we wanted.

--- This player felt the level editor was unintuitive, and also found a small bug in it, in that building blocks are not static colliders.

### Playtest 3: Interviewed by Mary
--- This playtester was also unclear on what the checkpoints were at first, but did end up running into them and realizing what they were while playing. 

--- The playtester also felt that the first level was very simple, and wanted more complexity. She wished it was more difficult, such as either involving some puzzle like a maze or just better mechanics.

### Playtest 4: Interviewed by Mary
--- This playtester said that the game was straightfoward to play, but wasn't clear what the consequences of running into the different objects (wall, ball, checkpoint) were.

--- Additionally, this player felt the color scheme could be improved.

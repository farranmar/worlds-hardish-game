Requirements we discussed with Evan:

Game: The game have 5 levels, which increase in difficulty as you progress. The player can save the game at any point during a level, and can also play and save custom-made levels.

Level Editor: The level editor is complete, and allows player to construct fully-formed levels of the game, and save those levels to play.

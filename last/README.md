## Primary Requirements:
| Requirement | Location in code or steps to view in game  |
|---|---|
|An object serving as a menu to drag in items from in order to create levels| see unitMenu in last.game.objects - while it's incomplete, that is what we'll be using and building upon|

Note: We never had a formal chance to discuss deliverables, so we tried to accomplish the main piece of the level editor for this checkpoint.

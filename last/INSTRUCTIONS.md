## Final II Instructions

**Play:** Click "play game" then "start new game" to enter Level 1. The player can move with WASD. Green squares are checkpoints, and the green area at the end is the end point, where the player must get to win the game. The player can run into walls, but hitting a ball will kill them.

You can also drag and drop things in the level editor, but it does not contain the pieces to make a functional level for this game (we will add them when we know all the options we want to give them).

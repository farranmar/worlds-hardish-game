## Final II Instructions

**Play:** Click "play game" then "start new game" to enter Level 1. The player can move with WASD. Green solid squares are checkpoints, and the green checked area is the end point, where the player must get to win the game. The player can run into walls, but hitting a death ball will kill them.

You can also drag and drop things in the level editor, as well as resize walls/checkpoints/endpoints and edit the movement path for each deathball. The player can place the spawn point anywhere on the map, but can only place one. Pressing shift will cause the elements on the board to snap to the underlying grid of 10 x 10 pixel squares. 

Both levels and games can be saved through the pause menu, then loaded through the start menu.

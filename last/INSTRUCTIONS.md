## Final II Instructions

**Play:** Click "play game" then "start new game" to enter Level 1. The player can move with WASD. Green squares are checkpoints, and the green area at the end is the end point, where the player must get to win the game. The player can run into walls, but hitting a ball will kill them.

You can also drag and drop things in the level editor, and can resize walls, checkpoints, and end areas using the red dots in their corner. For deathballs, move the endpoint of their paths to change their path, and move them along the path to change their starting location.
